 problem :- Design an efficient algorithm to convert an adjacency matrix to adjacencey List and also mention the time complexity
 
 Adjacency matrix representation is :-
     
 let the no of vertices be n then it can be represented as :
 int adj_mat[n][n];
 
 In order to convert it into adjacency list we will use an array of vectors.
 
 vector<int> adj_list[n];
 
 for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
 {
 	for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
 	{
 		if(adj_mat[i][j])
 		adj_list[i].push_back(j);
	}
 }
 
 Time complexity is :- O(n^2) as this is the time it takes to traverse an adjacency matrix
 Space complexity is :- O(m+n) where m is the no of edges and n is the no of vertices
