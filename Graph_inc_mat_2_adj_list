Problem:- We are to convert an incidence matrix reperesentation of graph into a ajacent list representation

incidence matrix representation:- 
int inc_mat[m][n]

Key Idea:- The key idea here is to traverse the matrix column wise so that for each column we find 2 non-zero elements and those are our
           two vertices which has the given edge between them represented as the column in the matrix
           
 
adj_list:-
vector<int> adj_list[n];


Matrix traversal

for(int i=0;i<m;i++)
{
	int src=-1;
	for(int j=0;j<n;j++ )
	{
		if(inc_mat[j][i] && src==-1)
		src=j;
		else if(inc_mat[j][i] )
		{
			adj_list[src].push_back(j);
			adj_lsit[j].push_back(src);
		}
	}
}


This is for undirected graph

time complexity is :- O(m*n)  time taken to traverse the whole matrix
