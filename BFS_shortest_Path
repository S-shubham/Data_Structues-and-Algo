BFS helps to find out the shotest path in a graph

required:-
queue;
visited_node[];
parent_node[];

To find the shortest path between two different nodes.
provided the graph is connected and the destination node is reachable from the source node.


The idea behind the BFS is to use a queue to keep track of the work to be done in a sequential manner.

the BFS expands layerwise.

once destination node is found we backtrack using the parent pointer
