Problem:- Algorithm to convert an adjacency list into incidence matrix

An incidence matrix is a matrix which has a representation of n*m matrix where n is the no of vertices and m is the no of edges
All the edges are uniquely defined in incidence matrix
In the case of undirected graph an edge going from i to j is same as an edge going from j to i

The below mentioned algorithm is for directed graph

1-> create an array of size n*m
int inc_mat[n][m];

2-> Initialize the newly created matrix 
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
for(int j=0;j<m;j++)
inc_mat[i][j]=0;



Representation of adjacency list is 
vector <in> adj_list[n];

// Assume that edges are numbered from 0 to n-1
int edge_no =0;

for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
	
	vector<int> :: iterator itr;
	for(itr=adj_list[i].begin();itr!=adj_list[i].end();++itr)
	{
		// there is an edge between vertex "i" and "*itr" 
		
		if(inc
		inc_mat[i][edge_no]=1;
		inc_mat[*itr][edge_no]=1;
		
		++edge_no;
		
	}
}

Time  complexity is :- O(n+m)
Space complexity is :- O(n*m)



** For undirected graph*****************************

Before we write anythig in the matrix we need to check for certain condition

if(i>j)
this way we make sure that each edge is couned only once

int edge_no =0;

for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
	
	vector<int> :: iterator itr;
	for(itr=adj_list[i].begin();itr!=adj_list[i].end();++itr)
	{
		// there is an edge between vertex "i" and "*itr" 
		
		
		if(i>j)
		{
			inc_mat[i][edge_no]=1;
			inc_mat[*itr][edge_no]=1;
			++edge_no;

		}
	}
}
