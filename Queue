Aim:- implement queue using various data strucutres like array and linked list. Additionally think of any other data structure which can
      implement queue. Do not give any consideration to the time complexity.
      
      List all the data  structure  that    you are familiar with. Find out the time complexity of all those data structures.
       
      Whenever you  are solving any  problem try to think of solving it using various  data st rucutres
